# pycaptioner

Easy image captioning with Python.

## About

Python utility to add text captions to any side of
an image. Wraps text, resizes as necessary, and produces a new image.

Easily scriptable, with command-line "cpt" program or by using the
underlying Python class.

Currently quite limited in its options for fonts and colors, and no
effects besides selecting text foreground and background.

## Installation

Clone or download repository contents, then use 
`python setup.py install` to install the library and
command-line tools.
